# SOCIALBIB v.0.5.0

Bib files are organized by topic-areas. Topics are social science
related, with a special focus on computational, experimental, and data
driven methods. Philosophy of science works are also included.

## Use and Contribute

You are free to use the files below for any use. You are welcome to
contribute by adding your own bibtex entries following the formatting
guidelines below.

## Formatting Guidelines

 - Keep the information to essential: do not add abstracts, do not add
   a publisher field into articles entries, do not add DOI or external
   links unless they are strictly necessary to locate the referenced
   material.

 - All words in titles are capitalized, excluding stop words such as:
   of, the, in at, etc. For example:
   
   `title = {The Beauty of Science: Theory and Applications},`

 - Use only the initials for first names. The author field should be
   formatted as follows:

   `author = { Lastname1, Initials1 and Lastname2, Initials2 },`

 - Entry labels should include the last name of the first author in
   full, one or more keywords identifying the content of the work, and
   the year of publication. Underscore is used to separate
   words. Everything should be lowercase. Example:
   
   `@article{balietti_fragmentation_2015,`
