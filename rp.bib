complex systems and transferring knowledge from the complex-systems sciences
to applications in business, industry and society. The interdisciplinary
contributions range from markets and production through logistics, traffic
control, and critical infrastructures, up to network design, information
systems, social conflicts and building consensus. They serve to raise readers'
awareness concerning the often counter-intuitive behavior of complex systems
and to help them integrate insights gained in complexity research into
everyday planning, decision making, strategic optimization, and policy.

Intended for a broad readership, the contributions have been kept largely non-
technical and address a general, scientifically literate audience involved in
corporate, academic, and public institutions.},

   abstract = {This address treats some enduring misconceptions about modeling. One of these is that the goal is always prediction. The lecture distinguishes between explanation and prediction as modeling goals, and offers sixteen reasons other than prediction to build a model. It also challenges the common assumption that scientific theories arise from and 'summarize' data, when often, theories precede and guide data collection; without theory, in other words, it is not clear what data to collect. Among other things, it also argues that the modeling enterprise enforces habits of mind essential to freedom.  It is based on the author's 2008 Bastille Day keynote address to the Second World Congress on Social Simulation, George Mason University, and earlier addresses at the Institute of Medicine, the University of Michigan, and the Santa Fe Institute.},

<p>Why do friends spontaneously come up with mutually accepted rules, cooperation, and solidarity, while the creation of shared moral standards often fails in large communities? In a “global village”, where everybody may interact with anybody else, it is not worthwhile to punish people who cheat. Moralists (cooperative individuals who undertake punishment efforts) disappear because of their disadvantage compared to cooperators who do not punish (so-called “second-order free-riders”). However, cooperators are exploited by free-riders. This creates a “tragedy of the commons”, where everybody is uncooperative in the end. Yet, when people interact with friends or local neighbors, as most people do, moralists can escape the direct competition with non-punishing cooperators by separating from them. Moreover, in the competition with free-riders, moralists can defend their interests better than non-punishing cooperators. Therefore, while seriously depleted in the beginning, moralists can finally spread all over the world (“who laughs last laughs best effect”). Strikingly, the presence of a few non-cooperative individuals (“deviant behavior”) can accelerate the victory of moralists. In order to spread, moralists may also form an “unholy cooperation” with people having double moral standards, i.e., free-riders who punish non-cooperative behavior, while being uncooperative themselves.</p>

    abstract = {We present an adaptive cruise control (ACC) strategy where the acceleration characteristics, that is, the driving style automatically adapts to different traffic situations. The three components of the concept are the ACC itself, implemented in the form of a car-following model, an algorithm for the automatic real-time detection of the traffic situation based on local information, and a strategy matrix to adapt the driving characteristics (that is, the parameters of the ACC controller) to the traffic conditions. Optionally, inter-vehicle and infrastructure-to-car communication can be used to improve the accuracy of determining the traffic states. Within a microscopic simulation framework, we have simulated the complete concept on a road section with an on-ramp bottleneck, using empirical loop-detector data for an afternoon rush-hour as input for the upstream boundary. We found that the ACC vehicles improve the traffic stability and the dynamic road capacity. While traffic congestion in the reference scenario was completely eliminated when simulating a proportion of 25\% ACC vehicles, travel times were already significantly reduced for much lower penetration rates. The efficiency of the proposed driving strategy even for low market penetrations is a promising result for a successful application in future driver assistance systems.},

Increasing the strength of social influence increased both inequality and unpredictability of success. Success was also only partly determined by quality: The best songs rarely did poorly, and the worst rarely did well, but any other result was possible. 10.1126/science.1121066},

    abstract = {This paper describes the parallel implementation of the TRansportation ANalysis and SIMulation System (TRANSIMS) traffic micro-simulation. The parallelization method is domain decomposition, which means that each CPU of the parallel computer is responsible for a different geographical area of the simulated region. We describe how information between domains is exchanged, and how the transportation network graph is partitioned. An adaptive scheme is used to optimize load balancing. We then demonstrate how computing speeds of our parallel micro-simulations can be systematically predicted once the scenario and the computer architecture are known. This makes it possible, e.g., to decide if a certain study is feasible with a certain computing budget, and how to invest that budget. The main ingredients of the prediction are knowledge about the parallel implementation of the micro-simulation, knowledge about the characteristics of the partitioning of the transportation network graph, and knowledge about the interaction of these quantities with the computer system. In particular, we investigate the differences between switched and non-switched topologies, and the effects of 10 Mbit, 100 Mbit, and Gbit Ethernet. As an example, we show that with a common technology – 100 Mbit switched Ethernet – one can run the 20 000-link EMME2-network for Portland (Oregon) more than 20 times faster than real time on 16 coupled Pentium CPUs.},

    abstract = {Multi-agent simulation has increasingly been used for transportation simulation in recent years. With current techniques, it is possible to simulate systems consisting of several million agents. Such multi-agent simulations have been applied to whole cities and even large regions. In this paper it is demonstrated how to adapt an existing multi-agent transportation simulation framework to large-scale pedestrian evacuation simulation. The underlying flow model simulates the traffic-based on a simple queue model where only free speed, bottleneck capacities, and space constraints are taken into account. The queue simulation, albeit simple, captures the most important aspects of evacuations such as the congestion effects of bottlenecks and the time needed to evacuate the endangered area. In the case of an evacuation simulation the network has time-dependent attributes. For instance, large-scale inundations or conflagrations do not cover all the endangered area at once. These time-dependent attributes are modeled as network change events. Network change events are modifying link parameters at predefined points in time. The simulation framework is demonstrated through a case study for the Indonesian city of Padang, which faces a high risk of being inundated by a tsunami.},

Here we introduce a probabilistic model that describes the worldwide spread of infectious diseases and demonstrate that a forecast of the geographical spread of epidemics is indeed possible. This model combines a stochastic local infection dynamics among individuals with stochastic transport in a worldwide network, taking into account national and international civil aviation traffic. Our simulations of the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak are in surprisingly good agreement with published case reports. We show that the high degree of predictability is caused by the strong heterogeneity of the network. Our model can be used to predict the worldwide spread of future infectious diseases and to identify endangered regions in advance. The performance of different control strategies is analyzed, and our simulations show that a quick and focused reaction is essential to inhibiting the global spread of epidemics.},

We find that the contact network among people is a strongly connected small-world-like5 graph with a well-defined scale for the degree distribution. However, the locations graph is scale-free6, which allows highly efficient outbreak detection by placing sensors in the hubs of the locations network. Within this large-scale simulation framework, we then analyse the relative merits of several proposed mitigation strategies for smallpox spread. Our results suggest that outbreaks can be contained by a strategy of targeted vaccination combined with early detection without resorting to mass vaccination of a population.},

abstract ={The systematic study of large-scale networks has unveiled the ubiquitous presence of connectivity patterns characterized by large-scale heterogeneities and unbounded statistical fluctuations. These features affect dramatically the behavior of the diffusion processes occurring on networks, determining the ensuing statistical properties of their evolution pattern and dynamics. In this article, we present a stochastic computational framework for the forecast of global epidemics that considers the complete worldwide air travel infrastructure complemented with census population data. We address two basic issues in global epidemic modeling: (i) we study the role of the large scale properties of the airline transportation network in determining the global diffusion pattern of emerging diseases; and (ii) we evaluate the reliability of forecasts and outbreak scenarios with respect to the intrinsic stochasticity of disease transmission and traffic flows. To address these issues we define a set of quantitative measures able to characterize the level of heterogeneity and predictability of the epidemic pattern. These measures may be used for the analysis of containment policies and epidemic risk assessment.},

The decision maker considered here is capable of manipulating information to serve her self-interests, but a tradeoff between distorted beliefs and distorted actions constrains the extent of information manipulation. Building on this tradeoff, the present model provides a unified framework to account for the conformity bias (excessive reliance on precedents) and the confirmatory bias (excessive attachment to initial perceptions).},

% Multi - Player Online Games studies

@article{szell:dynamics,
    abstract = {Quantification of human group-behavior has so far defied an empirical, falsifiable approach. This is due to tremendous difficulties in data acquisition of social systems. Massive multiplayer online games (MMOG) provide a fascinating new way of observing hundreds of thousands of simultaneously socially interacting individuals engaged in virtual economic activities. We have compiled a data set consisting of practically all actions of all players over a period of 3 years from a MMOG played by 300,000 people. This large-scale data set of a socio-economic unit contains all social and economic data from a single and coherent source. Players have to generate a virtual income through economic activities to 'survive' and are typically engaged in a multitude of social activities offered within the game. Our analysis of high-frequency log files focuses on three types of social networks, and tests a series of social-dynamics hypotheses. In particular we study the structure and dynamics of friend-, enemy- and communication networks. We find striking differences in topological structure between positive (friend) and negative (enemy) tie networks. All networks confirm the recently observed phenomenon of network densification. We propose two approximate social laws in communication networks, the first expressing betweenness centrality as the inverse square of the overlap, the second relating communication strength to the cube of the overlap. These empirical laws provide strong quantitative evidence for the Weak ties hypothesis of Granovetter. Further, the analysis of triad significance profiles validates well-established assertions from social balance theory. We find overrepresentation (underrepresentation) of complete (incomplete) triads in networks of positive ties, and vice versa for networks of negative ties. Empirical transition probabilities between triad classes provide evidence for triadic closure with extraordinarily high precision. For the first time we provide empirical results for large-scale networks of negative social ties. Whenever possible we compare our findings with data from non-virtual human groups and provide further evidence that online game communities serve as a valid model for a wide class of human societies. With this setup we demonstrate the feasibility for establishing a 'socio-economic laboratory' which allows to operate at levels of precision approaching those of the natural sciences. All data used in this study is fully anonymized; the authors have the written consent to publish from the legal department of the Medical University of Vienna.},

    abstract = {Quantifying human group dynamics represents a unique challenge. Unlike animals and other biological systems, humans form groups in both real (offline) and virtual (online) spaces—from potentially dangerous street gangs populated mostly by disaffected male youths to the massive global guilds in online role-playing games for which membership currently exceeds tens of millions of people from all possible backgrounds, age groups, and genders. We have compiled and analyzed data for these two seemingly unrelated offline and online human activities and have uncovered an unexpected quantitative link between them. Although their overall dynamics differ visibly, we find that a common team-based model can accurately reproduce the quantitative features of each simply by adjusting the average tolerance level and attribute range for each population. By contrast, we find no evidence to support a version of the model based on like-seeking-like (i.e., kinship or  ” homophily”).},

In reality, however, social cooperation can also arise spontaneously, based on local interactions rather than centralized control. The self-organization of cooperative behavior is particularly puzzling for social dilemmas related to sharing natural resources or creating common goods. Such situations are often described by the prisoner's dilemma. Here, we report the sudden outbreak of predominant cooperation in a noisy world dominated by selfishness and defection, when individuals imitate superior strategies and show success-driven migration. In our model, individuals are unrelated, and do not inherit behavioral traits. They defect or cooperate selfishly when the opportunity arises, and they do not know how often they will interact or have interacted with someone else. Moreover, our individuals have no reputation mechanism to form friendship networks, nor do they have the option of voluntary interaction or costly punishment. Therefore, the outbreak of prevailing cooperation, when directed motion is integrated in a game-theoretical model, is remarkable, particularly when random strategy mutations and random relocations challenge the formation and survival of cooperative clusters. Our results suggest that mobility is significant for the evolution of social order, and essential for its stabilization and maintenance.},

    abstract = {Research in parallel simulation has been around for more than two decades. However, the number of papers reporting on its application to real world problems is limited. At the 2002 PADS conference, researchers discussed the need to go beyond synchronization and performance issues, and, in particular, to demonstrate that parallel simulation could be used in real world applications outside military and network simulations. Since then, we have seen an increase in the number of papers on the parallel simulation applications in areas such as operations management and the physical sciences. This paper advocates the application of parallel simulation in population dynamics which is often used as the basis for policy planning and analysis. In this paper, we show how the simulation model is implemented using the musik parallel simulation library. We conduct some experiments to measure the simulation performance. The result shows that good event parallelism can be achieved.},

In <i>Generative Social Science</i>, Joshua Epstein argues that this powerful, novel technique permits the social sciences to meet a fundamentally new standard of explanation, in which one "grows" the phenomenon of interest in an artificial society of interacting agents: heterogeneous, boundedly rational actors, represented as mathematical or software objects. After elaborating this notion of generative explanation in a pair of overarching foundational chapters, Epstein illustrates it with examples chosen from such far-flung fields as archaeology, civil conflict, the evolution of norms, epidemiology, retirement economics, spatial games, and organizational adaptation. In elegant chapter preludes, he explains how these widely diverse modeling studies support his sweeping case for generative explanation.</p><p> This book represents a powerful consolidation of Epstein's interdisciplinary research activities in the decade since the publication of his and Robert Axtell's landmark volume, <i>Growing Artificial Societies</i>. Beautifully illustrated, <i>Generative Social Science</i> includes a CD that contains animated movies of core model runs, and programs allowing users to easily change assumptions and explore models, making it an invaluable text for courses in modeling at all levels.</p>}},

    comment = {Summary:

Chapter 1: "Agent-Based Computational Models and Generative Social Science"
The Chapter points out that agent-based models are very well suited to answering the question "How could the decentralized local interactions of heterogeneous autonomous agents generate the given regularity?" which I guess comes as no surprise to anyone who's familiar with ABMs but it goes on to explain (using mathematical formalisms - nice :) that ABMs are a form of deduction: given a set of rules, are they sufficient to produce an observed macroscopic outcome. As such it can be used to test an hypothesis in the sense that it can rule some possibilities out (this is discussed further in Chapter 3). Exploratory ABM usage can generate new hypotheses, but ultimately these must be tested elsewhere. The Chapter also discusses emergence, it debates that such a thing exists, but its definition of emergence is one of strong emergence, it doesn't include weak emergence.

Chapter 2: "Remarks on the Foundations of Agent-Based Generative Social Science"
More exploration on what ABMs are \& do; formalizes some of the deductive generation (shows that ABMs produce disjuntive normal forms) and also shows that there are equivalent equations for ABMs (though writing these down would be a pain ;)
Briefly mentions how ABMs are used for induction, though points out that this is  induction over a sample distribution of theorems.

Chapter 3: "Non-Explanatory Equilibria: An Extremely Simple Game with (Mostly) Unattainable Fixed Points"
Shows how, although some equilibria may exist in a game, that they may not ever be reachable, or be reachable in a reasonable amount of time.

Chapter 4: "Understanding Anasazi Culture Change through Agent-Based Modeling"
First of three chapters comparing how different models can illuminate, but not fully replicate, social and social-environmental dynamics.

Chapter 5: "Population Growth and Collapse in a Multiagent Model of the Kayenta Anasazi in Long House Valley"

Chapter 6: "The Evolution of Social Behaviour in the Prehistoric American Southwest"

Chapter 7: "Coordination in Transient Social Networks: An Agent-Based Computational Model of the Timing of Retirement"
Shows how a rational equilibrium point can take a long time to become established as a norm, even if a fraction of the population are perfectly rational.

Chapter 8: "The Emergence of Classes in a Multi-Agent Bargaining Model"
Shows how socio-economic classes may arise through memory of behaviour of agents with particular tags, which then get reinforced as predictable markers of agent behaviour.

Chapter 9: "Zones of Cooperation in the Prisoner's Dilemma Game"
Shows how the local rules can give rise to cooperative zones, even though defection is the overall dominant strategy.

Chapter 10: "Learning to be Thoughtless: Social Norms and Individual Computation"
Shows how agents can learn to think less about making decisions as norms arise.

Chapter 11: "Modeling Civil Violence: An Agent-Based Computational Approach"
<pun>A revolutionary approach</pun>

Chapter 12: "Toward a Containment Strategy for Smallpox Bioterror: An Individual-Based Computational Approach"
Explores strategies for containing smallpox outbreaks.

Chapter 13: "Growing Adaptive Organizations: An Agent-Based Computational Approach"
Explores conditions under which local interactions shape organisational structures, from a trading community structure to a hierarchical structure. The best communities were found to be those that can oscillate between the two as the environment changes; local rules need to be flexible to allow for this.},

in complex ecosystems more stable than populations in simple ecosystems? In
1973, Robert May addressed these questions in this classic book. May
investigated the mathematical roots of population dynamics and argued-counter

not lead to population stability. Stability and Complexity in Model
Ecosystems played a key role in introducing nonlinear mathematical models and
the study of deterministic chaos into ecology, a role chronicled in James
Gleick's book Chaos. In the quarter century since its first publication, the
book's message has grown in power. Nonlinear models are now at the center of
ecological thinking, and current threats to biodiversity have made questions
about the role of ecosystem complexity more crucial than ever. In a new

Originally published in 1976, this influential text hasoverseen the transition of ecology from an observational and descriptivesubject to one with a solid conceptual core. Indeed, it is a testament to itsinfluence that a great deal of the novel material presented in the earliereditions has now been incorporated into standard undergraduate textbooks. Itis now a quarter of a century since the publication of the second edition, anda thorough revision is timely.Theoretical Ecology provides a succinct, up-to-date overview of the field setin the context of applications, thereby bridging the traditional division oftheory and practice. It describes the recent advances in our understanding ofhow interacting populations of plants and animals change over time and space,in response to natural or human-created disturbance. In an integrated way,initial chapters give an account of the basic principles governing thestructure, function, and temporal and spatial dynamics of populations andcommunities of plants and animals. Later chapters outline applications ofthese ideas to practical issues including fisheries, infectious diseases,tomorrow's food supplies, climate change, and conservation biology. Throughoutthe book, emphasis is placed on questions which as yet remain unanswered.The editors have invited the top scientists in the field to collaborate withthe next generation of theoretical ecologists. The result is an accessible,advanced textbook suitable for senior undergraduate and graduate levelstudents as well as researchers in the fields of ecology, mathematicalbiology, environmental and resources management. It will also be of interestto the general reader seeking a better understanding of a range of globalenvironmental problems.},

@article{MaesFlacheHelbingPLoS,
    abstract = {{One of the most intriguing dynamics in biological systems is the emergence of clustering, in the sense that individuals self-organize into separate agglomerations in physical or behavioral space. Several theories have been developed to explain clustering in, for instance, multi-cellular organisms, ant colonies, bee hives, flocks of birds, schools of fish, and animal herds. A persistent puzzle, however, is the clustering of opinions in human populations, particularly when opinions vary continuously, such as the degree to which citizens are in favor of or against a vaccination program. Existing continuous opinion formation models predict \^{a}€{\oe}monoculture\^{a}€� in the long run, unless subsets of the population are perfectly separated from each other. Yet, social diversity is a robust empirical phenomenon, although perfect separation is hardly possible in an increasingly connected world. Considering randomness has not overcome the theoretical shortcomings so far. Small perturbations of individual opinions trigger social influence cascades that inevitably lead to monoculture, while larger noise disrupts opinion clusters and results in rampant individualism without any social structure. Our solution to the puzzle builds on recent empirical research, combining the integrative tendencies of social influence with the disintegrative effects of individualization. A key element of the new computational model is an adaptive kind of noise. We conduct computer simulation experiments demonstrating that with this kind of noise a third phase besides individualism and monoculture becomes possible, characterized by the formation of metastable clusters with diversity between and consensus within clusters. When clusters are small, individualization tendencies are too weak to prohibit a fusion of clusters. When clusters grow too large, however, individualization increases in strength, which promotes their splitting. In summary, the new model can explain cultural clustering in human societies. Strikingly, model predictions are not only robust to \^{a}€{\oe}noise\^{a}€�\^{a}€”randomness is actually the central mechanism that sustains pluralism and clustering.}},

  <p>Explaining the emergence and stability of cooperation has been a central challenge in biology, economics and sociology. Unfortunately, the mechanisms known to promote it either require elaborate strategies or hold only under restrictive conditions. Here, we report the emergence, survival, and frequent domination of cooperation in a world characterized by selfishness and a strong temptation to defect, when individuals can accumulate wealth. In particular, we study games with local adaptation such as the prisoner's dilemma, to which we add heterogeneity in payoffs. In our model, agents accumulate wealth and invest some of it in their interactions. The larger the investment, the more can potentially be gained or lost, so that present gains affect future payoffs. We find that cooperation survives for a far wider range of parameters than without wealth accumulation and, even more strikingly, that it often dominates defection. This is in stark contrast to the traditional evolutionary prisoner's dilemma in particular, in which cooperation rarely survives and almost never thrives. With the inequality we introduce, on the contrary, cooperators do better than defectors, even without any strategic behavior or exogenously imposed strategies. These results have important consequences for our understanding of the type of social and economic arrangements that are optimal and efficient.</p>

 abstract = {GDP growth is often measured poorly for countries and rarely measured at all for cities or subnational regions. We propose a readily available proxy: satellite data on lights at night. We develop a statistical framework that uses lights growth to augment existing income growth measures, under the assumption that measurement error in using observed light as an indicator of income is uncorrelated with measurement error in national income accounts. For countries with good national income accounts data, information on growth of lights is of marginal value in estimating the true growth rate of income, while for countries with the worst national income accounts, the optimal estimate of true income growth is a composite with roughly equal weights. Among poor-data countries, our new estimate of average annual growth differs by as much as 3 percentage points from official data. Lights data also allow for measurement of income growth in sub- and supranational regions. As an application, we examine growth in Sub Saharan African regions over the last 17 years. We find that real incomes in non-coastal areas have grown faster by 1/3 of an annual percentage point than coastal areas; non-malarial areas have grown faster than malarial ones by 1/3 to 2/3 annual percent points; and primate city regions have grown no faster than hinterland areas. Such applications point toward a research program in which “empirical growth” need no longer be synonymous with “national income accounts.”},

From a physics point of view, it is interesting to study conditions under which a coordination or cooperation of interacting entities will occur, be it spins, particles, bacteria, animals, or humans. Here, we analyze the case, where the entities are heterogeneous, particularly the case of two populations with conflicting interactions and two possible states. For such systems, explicit mathematical formulas will be determined for the stationary solutions and the associated eigenvalues, which determine their stability. In this way, four different types of system dynamics can be classified and the various kinds of phase transitions between them will be discussed. While these results are interesting from a physics point of view, they are also relevant for social, economic, and biological systems, as they allow one to understand conditions for (1) the breakdown of cooperation, (2) the coexistence of different behaviors ( ” subcultures”), (3) the evolution of commonly shared behaviors ( ” norms”), and (4) the occurrence of polarization or conflict.

challenged by individual self-interests. While game theory has studied this

behavior that is considered cooperative by one population might be perceived as
non-cooperative from the viewpoint of another.


To understand the dynamics and outcome of the competitive interactions within
and between groups, we study game-dynamical replicator equations for multiple
populations with incompatible interests and different power (be this due to
different population sizes, material resources, social capital, or other
factors). These equations allow us to address various important questions: For
example, can cooperation in the prisoner's dilemma be promoted, when two
interacting groups have different preferences? Under what conditions can costly
punishment, or other mechanisms, foster the evolution of norms? When does
cooperation fail, leading to antagonistic behavior, conflict, or even
revolutions? And what incentives are needed to reach peaceful agreements
between groups with conflicting interests?

In this contribution, we compare Kerner's three-phase traffic theory with the phase diagram approach for traffic models with a fundamental diagram. We discuss the inconsistent use of the term  ” traffic phase” and show that patterns demanded by three-phase traffic theory can be reproduced with simple two-phase models, if the model parameters are suitably specified and factors characteristic for real traffic flows are considered, such as effects of noise or heterogeneity or the actual freeway design (e.g. combinations of off- and on-ramps). Conversely, we demonstrate that models created to reproduce three-phase traffic theory create similar spatiotemporal traffic states and associated phase diagrams, no matter whether the parameters imply a fundamental diagram in equilibrium or non-unique flow- density relationships. In conclusion, there are different ways of reproducing the empirical stylized facts of spatiotemporal congestion patterns summarized in this contribution, and it appears possible to overcome the controversy by a more precise definition of the scientific terms and a more careful comparison of models and data, considering effects of the measurement process and the right level of detail in the traffic model used.}},

However, models of crowd dynamics are still lacking a systematic individual-level experimental verification, and the local mechanisms underlying the formation of collective patterns are not yet known in detail. We have conducted a set of well-controlled experiments with pedestrians performing simple avoidance tasks in order to determine the laws ruling their behaviour during interactions. The analysis of the large trajectory dataset was used to compute a behavioural map that describes the average change of the direction and speed of a pedestrian for various interaction distances and angles. The experimental results reveal features of the decision process when pedestrians choose the side on which they evade, and show a side preference that is amplified by mutual interactions. The predictions of a binary interaction model based on the above findings were then compared with bidirectional flows of people recorded in a crowded street. Simulations generate two asymmetric lanes with opposite directions of motion, in quantitative agreement with our empirical observations. The knowledge of pedestrian behavioural laws is an important step ahead in the understanding of the underlying dynamics of crowd behaviour and allows for reliable predictions of collective pedestrian movements under natural conditions.}},

    abstract = {{▪ Abstract  Sociologists often model social processes as interactions among variables. We review an alternative approach that models social life as interactions among adaptive agents who influence one another in response to the influence they receive. These agent-based models (ABMs) show how simple and predictable local interactions can generate familiar but enigmatic global patterns, such as the diffusion of information, emergence of norms, coordination of conventions, or participation in collective action. Emergent social patterns can also appear unexpectedly and then just as dramatically transform or disappear, as happens in revolutions, market crashes, fads, and feeding frenzies. ABMs provide theoretical leverage where the global patterns of interest are more than the aggregation of individual attributes, but at the same time, the emergent pattern cannot be understood without a bottom up dynamical model of the microfoundations at the relational level. We begin with a brief historical sketch of the shift from  ” factors” to  ” actors” in computational sociology that shows how agent-based modeling differs fundamentally from earlier sociological uses of computer simulation. We then review recent contributions focused on the emergence of social structure and social order out of local interaction. Although sociology has lagged behind other social sciences in appreciating this new methodology, a distinctive sociological contribution is evident in the papers we review. First, theoretical interest focuses on dynamic social networks that shape and are shaped by agent interaction. Second, ABMs are used to perform virtual experiments that test macrosociological theories by manipulating structural factors like network topology, social stratification, or spatial mobility. We conclude our review with a series of recommendations for realizing the rich sociological potential of this approach.}},

The articles move beyond the basic paradigm of the Prisoner's Dilemma to study
a rich set of issues, including how to cope with errors in perception or
implementation, how norms emerge, and how new political actors and regions of
shared culture can develop. They use the shared methodology of agent-based
modeling, a powerful technique that specifies the rules of interaction between
individuals and uses computer simulation to discover emergent properties of

In <i>Cities and Complexity</i>, Michael Batty offers a comprehensive view of urban dynamics in the context of complexity theory, presenting models that demonstrate how complexity theory can embrace a myriad of processes and elements that combine into organic wholes. He argues that bottom-up processes -- in which the outcomes are always uncertain -- can combine with new forms of geometry associated with fractal patterns and chaotic dynamics to provide theories that are applicable to highly complex systems such as cities.<br /> <br /> Batty begins with models based on cellular automata (CA), simulating urban dynamics through the local actions of automata. He then introduces agent-based models (ABM), in which agents are mobile and move between locations. These models relate to many scales, from the scale of the street to patterns and structure at the scale of the urban region. Finally, Batty develops applications of all these models to specific urban situations, discussing concepts of criticality, threshold, surprise, novelty, and phase transition in the context of spatial developments. Every theory and model presented in the book is developed through examples that range from the simplified and hypothetical to the actual. Deploying extensive visual, mathematical, and textual material, Cities and Complexity will be read both by urban researchers and by complexity theorists with an interest in new kinds of computational models.<br /> <br /> Sample chapters and examples from the book, and other related material, can be found at http://www.complexcity.info by clicking on the link to the left.}},

To understand decisions in the real world, we need a different, more psychologically plausible notion of rationality, and this book provides it. It is about fast and frugal heuristics--simple rules for making decisions when time is<br>pressing and deep thought an unaffordable luxury. These heuristics can enable both living organisms and artificial systems to make smart choices, classifications, and predictions by employing bounded rationality. <br> But when and how can such fast and frugal heuristics work? Can judgments based simply on one good reason be as accurate as those based on many reasons? Could less knowledge even lead to systematically better predictions than more knowledge? Simple Heuristics explores these questions, developing<br>computational models of heuristics and testing them through experiments and analyses. It shows how fast and frugal heuristics can produce adaptive decisions in situations as varied as choosing a mate, dividing resources among offspring, predicting high school drop out rates, and playing the stock<br>market. <br> As an interdisciplinary work that is both useful and engaging, this book will appeal to a wide audience.

\$Z^G=z(S^t)\$ is the approximate value of \$Z\$ obtained by the heuristic. If
\$z(S^t)\neq z(N)\$, let \$j=j\_t\$ minimize \$(f\_j|(z(S^t\cup\{j\})-z(S^t)))\$
over \$j\in N\backslash S^t\$. Set \$S^{t+1}=S^t\cup\{j\_t\}\$, and continue.
The author obtains bounds for the performance ratio \$Z^G/Z\$. In particular,
if \$z\$ is integer-valued, he shows that \$(Z^G/Z)\leq\sum\_{i=1}^d(1/i)\$,
where \$d=\text{Max}\{z\{j\}-z(\varphi)\colon j\in N\}\$. The author also
shows that there is no polynomially bounded algorithm based on looking at
function values \$z(S)\$ for some \$S\$, which can guarantee a performance
ratio less than a prescribed finite value.},

Applying economic analysis to the subjects of the political scientist, sociologist, and economist, Mr. Olson examines the extent to which the individuals that share a common interest find it in their individual interest to bear the costs of the organizational effort. </p><p> The theory shows that most organizations produce what the economist calls "public goods"--goods or services that are available to every member, whether or not he has borne any of the costs of providing them. Economists have long understood that defense, law and order were public goods that could not be marketed to individuals, and that taxation was necessary. They have not, however, taken account of the fact that private as well as governmental organizations produce public goods. </p><p> The services the labor union provides for the worker it represents, or the benefits a lobby obtains for the group it represents, are public goods: they automatically go to every individual in the group, whether or not he helped bear the costs. It follows that, just as governments require compulsory taxation, many large private organizations require special (and sometimes coercive) devices to obtain the resources they need. </p><p> This is not true of smaller organizations for, as this book shows, small and large organizations support themselves in entirely different ways. The theory indicates that, though small groups can act to further their interest much more easily than large ones, they will tend to devote too few resources to the satisfaction of their common interests, and that there is a surprising tendency for the "lesser" members of the small group to exploit the "greater" members by making them bear a disproportionate share of the burden of any group action. </p><p> All of the theory in the book is in Chapter 1; the remaining chapters contain empirical and historical evidence of the theory's relevance to labor unions, pressure groups, corporations, and Marxian class action. </p>}},

    abstract = {
<p>Human crowd motion is mainly driven by self-organized processes based on local interactions among pedestrians. While most studies of crowd behaviour consider only interactions among isolated individuals, it turns out that up to 70% of people in a crowd are actually moving in groups, such as friends, couples, or families walking together. These groups constitute medium-scale aggregated structures and their impact on crowd dynamics is still largely unknown. In this work, we analyze the motion of approximately 1500 pedestrian groups under natural condition, and show that social interactions among group members generate typical group walking patterns that influence crowd dynamics. At low density, group members tend to walk side by side, forming a line perpendicular to the walking direction. As the density increases, however, the linear walking formation is bent forward, turning it into a V-like pattern. These spatial patterns can be well described by a model based on social communication between group members. We show that the V-like walking pattern facilitates social interactions within the group, but reduces the flow because of its “non-aerodynamic” shape. Therefore, when crowd density increases, the group organization results from a trade-off between walking faster and facilitating social exchange. These insights demonstrate that crowd dynamics is not only determined by physical constraints induced by other pedestrians and the environment, but also significantly by communicative, social interactions among individuals.</p>

@article{Christakis_obesity,
    abstract = {{BACKGROUND: The prevalence of obesity has increased substantially over the past 30 years. We performed a quantitative analysis of the nature and extent of the person-to-person spread of obesity as a possible factor contributing to the obesity epidemic. METHODS: We evaluated a densely interconnected social network of 12,067 people assessed repeatedly from 1971 to 2003 as part of the Framingham Heart Study. The body-mass index was available for all subjects. We used longitudinal statistical models to examine whether weight gain in one person was associated with weight gain in his or her friends, siblings, spouse, and neighbors. RESULTS: Discernible clusters of obese persons (body-mass index [the weight in kilograms divided by the square of the height in meters], > or =30) were present in the network at all time points, and the clusters extended to three degrees of separation. These clusters did not appear to be solely attributable to the selective formation of social ties among obese persons. A person's chances of becoming obese increased by 57\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 6 to 123) if he or she had a friend who became obese in a given interval. Among pairs of adult siblings, if one sibling became obese, the chance that the other would become obese increased by 40\% (95\% CI, 21 to 60). If one spouse became obese, the likelihood that the other spouse would become obese increased by 37\% (95\% CI, 7 to 73). These effects were not seen among neighbors in the immediate geographic location. Persons of the same sex had relatively greater influence on each other than those of the opposite sex. The spread of smoking cessation did not account for the spread of obesity in the network. CONCLUSIONS: Network phenomena appear to be relevant to the biologic and behavioral trait of obesity, and obesity appears to spread through social ties. These findings have implications for clinical and public health interventions.}},

    abstract = {{Background The prevalence of smoking has decreased substantially in the United States over the past 30 years. We examined the extent of the person-to-person spread of smoking behavior and the extent to which groups of widely connected people quit together.  Methods We studied a densely interconnected social network of 12,067 people assessed repeatedly from 1971 to 2003 as part of the Framingham Heart Study. We used network analytic methods and longitudinal statistical models.  Results Discernible clusters of smokers and nonsmokers were present in the network, and the clusters extended to three degrees of separation. Despite the decrease in smoking in the overall population, the size of the clusters of smokers remained the same across time, suggesting that whole groups of people were quitting in concert. Smokers were also progressively found in the periphery of the social network. Smoking cessation by a spouse decreased a person's chances of smoking by 67\% (95\% confidence interval [CI], 59 to 73). Smoking cessation by a sibling decreased the chances by 25\% (95\% CI, 14 to 35). Smoking cessation by a friend decreased the chances by 36\% (95\% CI, 12 to 55 ). Among persons working in small firms, smoking cessation by a coworker decreased the chances by 34\% (95\% CI, 5 to 56). Friends with more education influenced one another more than those with less education. These effects were not seen among neighbors in the immediate geographic area.  Conclusions Network phenomena appear to be relevant to smoking cessation. Smoking behavior spreads through close and distant social ties, groups of interconnected people stop smoking in concert, and smokers are increasingly marginalized socially. These findings have implications for clinical and public health interventions to reduce and prevent smoking. 10.1056/NEJMsa0706154}},

In recognition of this social fact, there has been growing conceptual and empirical attention over the past decade to the impact of social networks on health.

We then discuss the policy implications of this body of work, as well as future research directions. We conclude that the existence of social networks means that people's health is interdependent and that health and health care can transcend the individual in ways that patients, doctors, policy makers, and researchers should care about.}},

@article{WhyResultsAreFalse,
    abstract = {{Summary There is increasing concern that most current published research findings are false. The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.}},

From the game theoretical perspective, inspectors anticipate the effect of increased punishments on criminal behavior and reduce their inspection activities accordingly. This implies that higher punishments reduce inspections and do not affect crime rates. We present two laboratory experiments, which challenge this perspective by demonstrating that both, criminals and inspectors, are affected by punishment levels. Thereupon, we investigate with agent-based simulations, whether models of bounded rationality can explain our empirical data. We differentiate between two kinds of bounded rationality; the first considers bounded learning from social interaction, the second bounded decision-making. Our results suggest that humans show both kinds of bounded rationality in the strategic situation of crime, control and punishment. We conclude that it is not the rationality but the bounded rationality in humans that makes punishment effective.},

@book{NewKinfOfScience,
    abstract = {{Physics and computer science genius Stephen Wolfram, whose Mathematica computer language launched a multimillion-dollar company, now sets his sights on a more daunting goal: understanding the universe. Wolfram lets the world see his work in <I>A New Kind of Science</I>, a gorgeous, 1,280-page tome more than a decade in the making. With patience, insight, and self-confidence to spare, Wolfram outlines a fundamental new way of modeling complex systems.<p>  On the frontier of complexity science since he was a boy, Wolfram is a  champion of cellular automata--256 "programs" governed by simple  nonmathematical rules. He points out that even the most complex  equations fail to accurately model biological systems, but the simplest  cellular automata can produce results straight out of nature--tree  branches, stream eddies, and leopard spots, for instance. The graphics  in <I>A New Kind of Science</I> show striking resemblance to the  patterns we see in nature every day.<p>  Wolfram wrote the book in a distinct style meant to make it easy to read,   even for nontechies; a basic familiarity with logic is helpful but  not essential. Readers will find themselves swept away by the elegant  simplicity of Wolfram's ideas and the accidental artistry of the  cellular automaton models. Whether or not Wolfram's revolution  ultimately gives us the keys to the universe, his new science is  absolutely awe-inspiring. <I>--Therese Littleton</I>} {This long-awaited work from one of the world's most respected scientists presents a series of dramatic discoveries never before made public. Starting from a collection of simple computer experiments---illustrated in the book by striking computer graphics---Wolfram shows how their unexpected results force a whole new way of looking at the operation of our universe.  <P>Wolfram uses his approach to tackle a remarkable array of fundamental problems in science: from the origin of the Second Law of thermodynamics, to the development of complexity in biology, the computational limitations of mathematics, the possibility of a truly fundamental theory of physics, and the interplay between free will and determinism.  <P>Written with exceptional clarity, and illustrated by more than a thousand original pictures, this seminal book allows scientists and non-scientists alike to participate in what promises to be a major intellectual revolution.}},

Sometimes this behaviour is triggered in life-threatening situations such as fires in crowded buildings1, 2; at other times, stampedes can arise during the rush for seats3, 4 or seemingly without cause. Although engineers are finding ways to alleviate the scale of such disasters, their frequency seems to be increasing with the number and size of mass events2, 5. But systematic studies of panic behaviour6, 7, 8, 9 and quantitative theories capable of predicting such crowd dynamics5, 10, 11, 12 are rare. Here we use a model of pedestrian behaviour to investigate the mechanisms of (and preconditions for) panic and jamming by uncoordinated motion in crowds. Our simulations suggest practical ways to prevent dangerous crowd pressures. Moreover, we find an optimal strategy for escape from a smoke-filled room, involving a mixture of individualistic behaviour and collective 'herding' instinct.}},

Yet, when they are given the opportunity to punish free riders, stable cooperation is maintained, although punishment is costly for those who punish. This paper asks whether there is a simple common principle that can explain this puzzling evidence. We show that if some people care about equity the puzzles can be resolved.

the price of a single asset traded by a population of heterogeneous interacting
agents in the presence of uncertainty and regulatory constraints. The model
takes into account (i) the price formation delay between decision and
investment by the second-order nature of the dynamical equations, (ii) the
linear and nonlinear mean-reversal or their contrarian in the form of
speculative price trading, (iii) market friction, (iv) uncertainty in the
fundamental value which controls the amplitude of mispricing, (v) nonlinear
speculative momentum effects and (vi) market regulations that may limit large
mispricing drifts. We find markets with coexisting equilibrium, conventions and
business cycles, which depend on (a) the relative strength of value-investing
versus momentum-investing, (b) the level of uncertainty on the fundamental
value and (c) the degree of market regulation. The stochastic dynamics is
characterized by nonlinear geometric random walk-like processes with
spontaneous regime shifts between different conventions or business cycles.
This model provides a natural dynamical framework to model regime shifts
between different market phases that may result from the interplay between the
effects (i-vi).}},
