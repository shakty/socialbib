Few indeed are the philosophers or historians influential enough to make it into the funny papers, but Kuhn is one.<p>  <I>The Structure of Scientific Revolutions</I> is indeed a paradigmatic work in the history of science. Kuhn's use of terms such as "paradigm shift" and "normal science," his ideas of how scientists move from disdain through doubt to acceptance of a new theory, his stress on social and psychological factors in science--all have had profound effects on historians, scientists, philosophers, critics, writers, business gurus, and even the cartoonist in the street.<p>  Some scientists (such as Steven Weinberg and Ernst Mayr) are profoundly irritated by Kuhn, especially by the doubts he casts--or the way  his work has been used to cast doubt--on the idea of scientific progress. Yet it has been said that the acceptance of plate tectonics in the 1960s, for instance, was sped by geologists' reluctance to be on the downside of a paradigm shift. Even Weinberg has said that "<I>Structure</I> has had a wider influence than any other book on the history of science." As one of Kuhn's obituaries noted, "We all live in a post-Kuhnian age." <I>--Mary Ellen Curtin</I> }},

    abstract = {Contemporary scholarly discourse follows many alternative routes in addition
to the three-century old tradition of publication in peer-reviewed journals.
The field of High- Energy Physics (HEP) has explored alternative communication
strategies for decades, initially via the mass mailing of paper copies of
preliminary manuscripts, then via the inception of the first online
repositories and digital libraries.


This field is uniquely placed to answer recurrent questions raised by the
current trends in scholarly communication: is there an advantage for scientists
to make their work available through repositories, often in preliminary form?
Is there an advantage to publishing in Open Access journals? Do scientists
still read journals or do they use digital repositories?


The analysis of citation data demonstrates that free and immediate online
dissemination of preprints creates an immense citation advantage in HEP,
whereas publication in Open Access journals presents no discernible advantage.
In addition, the analysis of clickstreams in the leading digital library of the
field shows that HEP scientists seldom read journals, preferring preprints
instead.},

    abstract = {Background The h-index has already been used by major citation databases to evaluate the academic performance of individual scientists. Although effective and simple, the h-index suffers from some drawbacks that limit its use in accurately and fairly comparing the scientific output of different researchers. These drawbacks include information loss and low resolution: the former refers to the fact that in addition to h2 citations for papers in the h-core, excess citations are completely ignored, whereas the latter means that it is common for a group of researchers to have an identical h-index. Methodology/Principal Findings To solve these problems, I here propose the e-index, where e2 represents the ignored excess citations, in addition to the h2 citations for h-core papers. Citation information can be completely depicted by using the h-index together with the e-index, which are independent of each other. Some other h-type indices, such as a and R, are h-dependent, have information redundancy with h, and therefore, when used together with h, mask the real differences in excess citations of different researchers. Conclusions/Significance Although simple, the e-index is a necessary h-index complement, especially for evaluating highly cited scientists or for precisely comparing the scientific output of a group of scientists having an identical h-index.},

How can we measure the prestige of a journal or of a conference? The evaluation
of the scientific work of a scientist and the estimation of the quality of a
journal or conference has long attracted significant interest, due to the
benefits from obtaining an unbiased and fair criterion. Although it appears to
be simple, defining a quality metric is not an easy task. To overcome the
disadvantages of the present metrics used for ranking scientists and journals,
J.E. Hirsch proposed a pioneering metric, the now famous h-index. In this
article, we demonstrate several inefficiencies of this index and develop a pair
of generalizations and effective variants of it to deal with scientist ranking
and with publication forum ranking. The new citation indices are able to
disclose trendsetters in scientific research, as well as researchers that
constantly shape their field with their influential work, no matter how old
they are. We exhibit the effectiveness and the benefits of the new indices to
unfold the full potential of the h-index, with extensive experimental results
obtained from DBLP, a widely known on-line digital library.},

  abstract={Revolutionary developments in economics are rare. The conservative bias of the field and its enshrined knowledge make it difficult to introduce new ideas not in line with received theory. Happiness research, however, has the potential to change economics substantially. Its findings, which are gradually being taken into account in standard economics, can be considered revolutionary in three respects: the measurement of experienced utility using psychologists' tools for measuring subjective well-being, new insights into how human beings value goods and services and social conditions that include consideration of such non-material values as autonomy and social relations, and policy consequences of these new insights that suggest different ways for government to affect individual well-being. In Happiness, Bruno Frey, emphasizing empirical evidence rather than theoretical conjectures, substantiates these three revolutionary claims for happiness research. After tracing the major developments of happiness research in economics and demonstrating that we have gained important new insights into how income, unemployment, inflation, and income demonstration affect well-being, Frey examines democracy and federalism, self-employment and volunteer work, marriage, terrorism, and watching television from the new perspective of happiness research. Turning to policy implications, Frey describes how government can provide the conditions under which people can achieve well-being, arguing that effective political institutions and decentralized decision making play crucial roles. Happiness demonstrates the achievements of the economic happiness revolution and points the way to future research.},

contributions range from markets and production through logistics, traffic

systems, social conflicts and building consensus. They serve to raise readers'
awareness concerning the often counter-intuitive behavior of complex systems
and to help them integrate insights gained in complexity research into
everyday planning, decision making, strategic optimization, and policy.

Intended for a broad readership, the contributions have been kept largely non-

abstract ={We study the distributions of citations received by a single publication within several disciplines, spanning broad areas of science. We show that the probability that an article is cited c times has large variations between different disciplines, but all distributions are rescaled on a universal curve when the relative indicator cf = c/c0 is considered, where c0 is the average number of citations per article for the discipline. In addition we show that the same universal behavior occurs when citation distributions of articles published in the same field, but in different years, are compared. These findings provide a strong validation of cf as an unbiased indicator for citation performance across disciplines and years. Based on this indicator, we introduce a generalization of the h index suitable for comparing scientists working in different fields.},

The severity of the criticism was the same in those papers as in the 58 without author replies (mean score 2.2 in both groups, P=0.72). For the 47 criticisms with replies, there was no relation between the severity of the criticism and the adequacy of the reply, neither as judged by the editors (P=0.88 and P=0.95, respectively) nor by the critics (P=0.83; response rate 85%). However, the critics were much more critical of the replies than the editors (average score 2.3 v 1.4, P<0.001).Conclusions Authors are reluctant to respond to criticisms of their work, although they are not less likely to respond when criticisms are severe. Editors should ensure that authors take relevant criticism seriously and respond adequately to it.},

    abstract = {One of the virtues of peer review is that it provides a self-regulating
selection mechanism for scientific work, papers and projects. Peer review as a
selection mechanism is hard to evaluate in terms of its efficiency. Serious
efforts to understand its strengths and weaknesses have not yet lead to clear
answers. In theory peer review works if the involved parties (editors and
referees) conform to a set of requirements, such as love for high quality
science, objectiveness, and absence of biases, nepotism, friend and clique
networks, selfishness, etc. If these requirements are violated, what is the
effect on the selection of high quality work? We study this question with a
simple agent based model. In particular we are interested in the effects of
rational referees, who might not have any incentive to see high quality work
other than their own published or promoted. We find that a small fraction of
incorrect (selfish or rational) referees can drastically reduce the quality of
the published (accepted) scientific standard. We quantify the fraction for
which peer review will no longer select better than pure chance. Decline of
quality of accepted scientific work is shown as a function of the fraction of
rational and unqualified referees. We show how a simple quality-increasing
policy of e.g. a journal can lead to a loss in overall scientific quality, and
how mutual support-networks of authors and referees deteriorate the system.},

abstract = {Although much research has examined the effect of income on happiness, we suggest that how people spend their money may be at least as important as how much money they earn. Specifically, we hypothesized that spending money on other people may have a more positive impact on happiness than spending money on oneself. Providing converging evidence for this hypothesis, we found that spending more of one's income on others predicted greater happiness both cross-sectionally (in a nationally representative survey study) and longitudinally (in a field study of windfall spending). Finally, participants who were randomly assigned to spend money on others experienced greater happiness than those assigned to spend money on themselves.

    abstract = {We aimed to determine the reproducibility of assessments made by independent reviewers of papers submitted for publication to clinical neuroscience journals and abstracts submitted for presentation at clinical neuroscience conferences. We studied two journals in which manuscripts were routinely assessed by two reviewers, and two conferences in which abstracts were routinely scored by multiple reviewers. Agreement between the reviewers as to whether manuscripts should be accepted, revised or rejected was not significantly greater than that expected by chance [{kappa} = 0.08, 95\% confidence interval (CI) -0.04 to -0.20] for 179 consecutive papers submitted to Journal A, and was poor ({kappa} = 0.28, 0.12 to 0.40) for 116 papers submitted to Journal B. However, editors were very much more likely to publish papers when both reviewers recommended acceptance than when they disagreed or recommended rejection (Journal A, odds ratio = 73, 95\% CI = 27 to 200; Journal B, 51, 17 to 155). There was little or no agreement between the reviewers as to the priority (low, medium, or high) for publication (Journal A, {kappa} = -0.12, 95\% CI -0.30 to -0.11; Journal B, {kappa} = 0.27, 0.01 to 0.53). Abstracts submitted for presentation at the conferences were given a score of 1 (poor) to 6 (excellent) by multiple independent reviewers. For each conference, analysis of variance of the scores given to abstracts revealed that differences between individual abstracts accounted for only 10-20\% of the total variance of the scores. Thus, although recommendations made by reviewers have considerable influence on the fate of both papers submitted to journals and abstracts submitted to conferences, agreement between reviewers in clinical neuroscience was little greater than would be expected by chance alone. 10.1093/brain/123.9.1964},

@article{citeulike:1040330,
    abstract = {This account of the Matthew effect is another small exercise in the psychosociological analysis of the workings of science as a social institution. The initial problem is transformed by a shift in theoretical perspective. As originally identified, the Matthew effect was construed in terms of enhancement of the position of already eminent scientists who are given disproportionate credit in cases of collaboration or of independent multiple discoveries. Its significance was thus confined to its implications for the reward system of science. By shifting the angle of vision, we note other possible kinds of consequences, this time for the communication system of science. The Matthew effect may serve to heighten the visibility of contributions to science by scientists of acknowledged standing and to reduce the visibility of contributions by authors who are less well known. We examine the psychosocial conditions and mechanisms underlying this effect and find a correlation between the redundancy function of multiple discoveries and the focalizing function of eminent men of science--a function which is reinforced by the great value these men place upon finding basic problems and by their self-assurance. This self-assurance, which is partly inherent, partly the result of experiences and associations in creative scientific environments, and partly a result of later social validation of their position, encourages them to search out risky but important problems and to highlight the results of their inquiry. A macrosocial version of the Matthew principle is apparently involved in those processes of social selection that currently lead to the concentration of scientific resources and talent (50). 10.1126/science.159.3810.56},

The introduction discusses challenges towards a theoretically grounded and practically useful science of science. It provides a brief chronological review of relevant work and argues for (1) the development of common frameworks for the comparison and combination of existing approaches, theories, laws, and measurements, (2) the combination of quantitative and qualitative studies of science, and (3) the operationalization of theoretical concepts in terms of measurement and empirical evidence. Next, three visual conceptualizations of science are discussed and compared. Each of them provides a framework for the comparison and combination of existing works, means to combine quantitative and qualitative data, and helps to operationalize and communicate theoretical concepts using empirical data. Last but not least, the contributions of and interlinkages among the papers included in this issue are discussed.},

The co-citation frequency of two scientific papers can be determined by comparing lists of citing documents in the Science Citation Index and counting identical entries. Networks of co-cited papers can be generated for specific scientific specialties, and an example is drawn from the literature of particle physics. Co-citation patterns are found to differ significantly from bibliographic coupling patterns, but to agree generally with patterns of direct citation. Clusters of co-cited papers provide a new way to study the specialty structure of science. They may provide a new approach to indexing and to the creation of SDI profiles.},

<title>Background</title>
<p>Intricate maps of science have been created from citation data to visualize the structure of scientific activity. However, most scientific publications are now accessed online. Scholarly web portals record detailed log data at a scale that exceeds the number of all existing citations combined. Such log data is recorded immediately upon publication and keeps track of the sequences of user requests (clickstreams) that are issued by a variety of users across many different domains. Given these advantages of log datasets over citation data, we investigate whether they can produce high-resolution, more current maps of science.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Methodology</title>
<p>Over the course of 2007 and 2008, we collected nearly 1 billion user interactions recorded by the scholarly web portals of some of the most significant publishers, aggregators and institutional consortia. The resulting reference data set covers a significant part of world-wide use of scholarly web portals in 2006, and provides a balanced coverage of the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences. A journal clickstream model, i.e. a first-order Markov chain, was extracted from the sequences of user interactions in the logs. The clickstream model was validated by comparing it to the Getty Research Institute's Architecture and Art Thesaurus. The resulting model was visualized as a journal network that outlines the relationships between various scientific domains and clarifies the connection of the social sciences and humanities to the natural sciences.</p>
</sec><sec>
<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Maps of science resulting from large-scale clickstream data provide a detailed, contemporary view of scientific activity and correct the underrepresentation of the social sciences and humanities that is commonly found in citation data.</p>
